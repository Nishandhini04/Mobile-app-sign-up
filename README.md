# Project Title: Mobile Login & Sign-Up Interface Design

## Overview
This project includes three interface designs created on Figma for the login and sign-up process of a mobile application. Each design is tailored to provide users with a seamless experience while navigating through authentication steps.

## Screens
- **Screen 1 (Login):** Offers users the option to log in using their email address or via social networks.
- **Screen 2 (Sign-Up):** Allows new users to register either by providing their email details or by connecting through Facebook or Google.
- **Screen 3 (Social Networks Login):** Provides existing users the ability to log in using their preferred social network accounts or by entering their registered email.

## Design Highlights
- Clean and user-friendly interfaces.
- Consistent design language across all screens.
- Intuitive graphical elements aiding user interaction.

## Usage
These designs can be used as templates for developing authentication flows within mobile applications. They are customizable according to branding requirements.

## File Structure
The Figma file contains three frames corresponding to each step of the authentication process:
1. Login Screen
2. Sign-Up Screen
3. Social Networks Login Screen

Each frame includes vector graphics, text fields, buttons, and icons that are editable.
